In this sample project i'm using:
+ MVVM + Clean Architecture : this is the most popular architecture nowadays with lots of benefits (easy to manage, scale, testing, ...)
+ Retrofit for Network request: popular library, easy to use, integrates well OkHttp, RxJava, Coroutines, customize the client, interceptor,...
+ Glide for load image from url: the most popular and easiest
+ Kotlin Coroutine and Kotlin Flow to handle asynchronous code: i want to show that i can use new tech instead of older popular ones like RxJava/LiveData
+ Dagger Hilt for Dependency Injection: reduces the lost boilerplate code, easy to use
